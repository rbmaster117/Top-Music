        <pre> This world that I've found is too good to be true
        Standing here beside you, want so much to give you
        This love in my heart that I'm feeling for you
        Let 'em say we're crazy, I don't care about that
        Put your hand in my hand, baby, don't ever look back
        Let the world around us just fall apart
        Baby, we can make it if we're heart to heart
        And we can build this dream together
        Standing strong forever
        Nothing's gonna stop us now
        And if this world runs out of lovers
        We'll still have each other
        Nothing's gonna stop us
        Nothing's gonna stop us now, no
        I'm so glad I found you, I'm not gonna lose you
        Whatever it takes, I will stay here with you
        Take it to the good times, see it through the bad times
        Whatever it takes is what I'm gonna do
        Let 'em say we're crazy, what do they know?
        Put your arms around me, baby, don't ever let go
        Let the world around us just fall apart
        Baby, we can make it if we're heart to heart
        And we can build this dream together
        Standing strong forever
        Nothing's gonna stop us now
        And if this world runs out of lovers
        We'll still have each other
        Nothing's gonna stop us
        Nothing's gonna stop us
        Oh, all that I need is you, baby
        You're all that I ever need
        And all that I want to do
        Is hold you forever, forever and ever
        Hey
        And we can build this dream together
        Standing strong forever
        Nothing's gonna stop us now
        And if this world runs out of lovers
        We'll still have each other
        Nothing's gonna stop us
        Nothing's gonna stop us
        (Build this dream together)
        (Standing strong forever) hey, baby
        (Nothing's gonna stop us now)
        Nothing gonna stop us now
