        I'm seein' better when I'm in the dark
        You leave me standin' in the pouring rain
        And I, I can't believe it, I can't believe it, I, I
        Lost all your money on the color black
        You sold your soul but couldn't win it back
        They gave you nothin' but a nothin' hand
        And, I can't believe it, I can't believe it (can't believe it)
        I'm flyin' high on the wings of a wasted life, oh-whoa
        We could be kings, just some kids from Pacific Heights, oh-who's
        Just watch me fake it, fake it
        'Til I make it, make it
        Just watch me fake it, fake it
        Until I make it, make it
        I try to make my way and never quit
        My real life just don't compare to this
        Just leave me dreamin', never wake me up
        No I, I can't believe it, I can't believe it
        Every night I swear I feel it comin', oh
        Turnin' all the nothing into somethin', somethin'
        I'm flyin' high on the wings of a wasted life, oh-whoa
        We could be kings, just some kids from Pacific Heights, oh-whoa
        Just watch me fake it, fake it
        'Til I make it, make it
        Just watch me fake it, fake it
        Until I make it, make it
        Every night I swear I feel it coming
        Turnin' all the nothing into somethin', somethin'
        I'm flyin' high on the wings of a wasted life, oh-whoa
        We could be kings, just some kids from Pacific Heights, oh-whoa
        Just watch me fake it, fake it
        'Til I make it, make it
        Just watch me fake it, fake it
        Until I make it, make it</pre></center></font>
