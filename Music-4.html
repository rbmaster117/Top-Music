          <pre>You know I gotta have it
            Whoa, oh, oh
            So I ruffle through the cabinet
            With a crooked moan
            Kinda queasy on the red ones
            So I took all of the blue ones
            Feeling hotter than a glue gun
            I said "Let's go, go, go"
            I hold hands with cosmic entities
            I'll take this tube ride if I please
            I got this sweet tooth, baby
            Yeah, I got this sweet tooth, baby
            I exploit my opportunities
            Some broken hearts, numb cavities
            I got this sweet tooth, baby
            Yeah, I got this sweet tooth, baby, yeah
            I'm a savage in a basement
            Whoa, oh, oh
            I'm fighting with a chotchkes
            In a stranger's home
            I'm way over the tree line
            Roaring like a feline
            Still coming up the incline
            Saying "More, more, more"
            I hold hands with cosmic entities
            I'll take this tube out if I please
            I got this sweet tooth, baby
            Yeah, I got this sweet tooth, baby
            I exploit my opportunities
            Some broken hearts, numb cavities
            I got this sweet tooth, baby
            Yeah, I got this sweet tooth, baby, yeah
            (Sweet tooth)
            (Sweet tooth)
            When will they realize
            Guy with the crazy eyes
            Never had an invite?
            Kick me out, I don't mind
            Helicopter by the stop sign
            Pretending that it's a strobe light
            Kick me out, I'm not phased
            I'm on another plane
            I hold hands with cosmic entities
            I'll take this tube out if I please
            I got this sweet tooth, baby
            Yeah, I got this sweet tooth, baby
            I exploit my opportunities
            Some broken hearts, numb cavities
            I got this sweet tooth, baby
            Yeah, I got this sweet tooth, baby, yeah
            (Sweet tooth)
            I can never find a refuge
            Yeah, I'm always on a sweet tooth
            (Sweet tooth)
            Maybe I'm a little cuckoo
            'Cause I'm always on a sweet tooth</pre></center></font></b>
